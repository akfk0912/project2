  <h2 class="title"> Introduce </h2>
  <p>Since its foundation in 1946, Hongik University has created practical scholasticism and nurtured creative talent based on a founding philosophy of ‘humanitarianism’ and principle of ‘academic-industrial integration.’ Over 150,000 students have graduated under the name of ‘Hongik’, and these graduates have been a driving force in the nation’s development playing a pivotal role in various fields of society.Hongik University boasts a world class faculty with the highest educational backgrounds and experience in diverse fields, and our respected faculty members educate students at various locations of over 2 million m2 in campus area. The University’s locations are organically connected through a cooperative network, consisting of the attractive Seoul Campus in the busy capital, Sejong Campus located in the new city of Sejong, Daehakro Campus consisting of the Cultural Arts Graduate School and academic-industrial collaboration facilities, and Hwaseong Campus practicum site situated in a lush forest environment.Last year, we awarded an average of 3.64 million KRW in scholarship funds per student, the highest level of scholarship amounts in the nation. In doing this, 27.9% of tuition funds were returned to our students. We also built and opened Sejong Center totaling 11,500㎡ in size at the Sejong Campus, while subsequent other improvements in education facilities are currently under progress. The Seoul Campus is currently renovating expanded educational spaces and facilities secured with the relocation of its attached Elementary, Middle, and High Schools. Additionally, in February 2016, the construction of Dormitory ll with a capacity to accommodate 1,066 students, and the Fine Arts Lecture Building spreading over 6,250㎡ were both completed. Along with these upgrades, the construction of Dormitory lll started in June 2015, as we continue our devotion to improve the educational environment for our students.

  <h2 class="title"> Philosophy of Education </h2>
  <p>The educational goal of Hongik University is to forge the strongest possible link between academia and industry to provide service for the benefit of all humankind. The name "Hongik", translated into English, literally means "service to mankind."
		 In pursuing this goal, we prepare our students for varied careers, and they are first encouraged to foster independent thinking, free from the influence of others. Intellectual independence is thus our first educational objective. Our second objective is the development of students' cooperative spirit.
		 Cooperation is vital for individual betterment during one's lifetime, and it is this cooperative ability that we strive to cultivate in our students. While each individual may live independently, society also requires that individuals live in harmony with fellow human beings.
		 People always learn from the knowledge and experience of others. Hongik University strives to guide students to live in a community where human interaction is essential. This spirit of cooperation, our second objective, will lead our students to work together for the betterment of humankind.
		 Our third academic obective is the development of students' creativity. Creativity is vital in seeking individual happiness during one's lifetime, and it is this creative ability that we want our students to have. In short, Hongik University inculcates students with values necessary to serve society as independent, cooperative, and creative professionals.</p>
